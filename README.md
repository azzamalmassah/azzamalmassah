# 👋 Hi, I'm Azzam Almassah

💻 **Backend Developer | MERN Stack | C++ Programmer | Problem Solver**

I am a Computer Applications graduate with hands-on experience in **backend and full-stack development**. I build projects using the **MERN stack** and **C++**, focusing on clean code, logical problem-solving, and scalable application design.

I enjoy developing backend systems, console-based applications, and real-world projects that strengthen my understanding of software engineering fundamentals. I am currently expanding my backend skill set by learning **C# and ASP.NET**, along with **SQL and relational database concepts**.
